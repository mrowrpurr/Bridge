# Papyrus <--> Skyrim Platform Bridge

> Communicate _easily_ between Papyrus and Skyrim Platform

# ðŸŒ‰

Skyrim Platform is lovely.

But communication between Papyrus and Skyrim Platform is not easy.

This makes it really easy!

To install, simply download using your favorite mod manager.

Depending on your TypeScript setup, you will also want to open the mod folder and copy the `Platform\Modules\papyrusBridge.ts` file from the downloaded mod to `Skyrim Special Edition\Data\Platform\Modules\`

## Hello, world!

A common use-case nowadays for using Papyrus alongside Skyrim Platform is:

- Using Papyrus to capture Papyrus events.

In this example, we'll capture a keyboard event and send it to Skyrim Platform.

> ðŸ’¡ As of 2021, Skyrim Platform supports [listening for Papyrus Events](https://github.com/skyrim-multiplayer/skymp/blob/main/docs/skyrim_platform/events.md) triggered on objects in the game, but it is very slow and not recommended at this time.

### I. Create a Skyrim Mod (.esp)

Name it something like `HelloBridge.esp`

### II. Setup a Reference Alias for PlayerRef

I'm assuming you know how to create a new Quest and setup a Quest Alias pointing to the PlayerRef.

If not, see this video: [Attaching Skyrim scripts to player events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqaef3ETChU&list=PLektTyeQhBZdV_qI4uQcbOSBJ_QemyhsR&index=6)

### III. Create Your Papyrus Script

Add an attached script to the PlayerRef alias, e.g. `HelloBridge`

### IV. Edit Script

We'll be using `SkyrimPlatformConnection` which is a base script used to simplify communication between _your mod's_ Papyrus and _your mod's_ TypeScript.

Later, we'll look at using the `SkyrimPlatformBridge` Papyrus script which can be used globally from any Papyrus Script.

Update `HelloBridge.psc` with the following code:

```psc
scriptName HelloBridge extends SkyrimPlatformConnection

; Let's say we will do something when you press
; Left Shift + B
int LEFT_SHIFT_KEY = 42
int B_KEY = 48

event OnSetup()
    ; The 'Connection Name' is used to establish a connection
    ; between Papyrus and Skyrim Platform
    ConnectionName = "HelloBridge"
endEvent

event OnConnected()
    ; Do something when connection to Skyrim Platform is established
    RegisterForKey(B_KEY)
endEvent

event OnKeyDown(int keyCode)
    if keyCode == B_KEY && Input.IsKeyPressed(LEFT_SHIFT)
        ; Tell Skyrim Platform about the key press
        Send("Keyboard Shortcut Presed")
    endIf
endEvent
```

### V: Create Skyrim Platform Script

Add the following to a new or existing `.ts` script in your plugin:

```ts
import { getConnection } from "papyrusBridge";

// Get a connection to your Papyrus code.
// The connection name should be the same here as in Papyrus.
const papyrus = getConnection("HelloBridge");

papyrus.onEvent((event) => {
  if (event.eventName == "Keyboard Shortcut Presed") {
    // Note: onEvent can be called in contexts where `Debug.messageBox` does not work.
    // You can use `once('update')` to be able to `Debug.messageBox`
    once("update", () => {
      Debug.messageBox("The keyboard shortcut was pressed!");
    });
  }
});
```

> ðŸ’¡ If `'papyrusBridge'` does not autocomplete or your script does not compile, copy the `Platform\Modules\papyrusBridge.ts` file from the downloaded mod to `Skyrim Special Edition\Data\Platform\Modules\`

### VI: Run the Game!

Run the game and press Left Shift + B
